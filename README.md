# Geometry Construction Set

With this playground you can verify some fundamental geometric theorems :

* Demo 2: In a triangle the three medians intersect at the same point, the center of gravity.

* Demo 3: In a triangle the three heights intersect at the same point, the orthocenter.

* Demo 4: In a triangle the three bisectors intersect at the same point, the center of the inscribed circle.

* Demo 5: The three circles intersect at the same point, the Miquel point.

* Demo 6: In a triangle, the three mediators intersect at the same point, the center of the circumscribed circle.

* Demo 7: The middle sides of any quadrilateral form the Varignon parallelogram.

* Demo 8: Construction of a pentagon inscribed in a circle:

* Demo 9: In a triangle, the triangle formed by the midpoints of the sides has its sides parallel to the original triangle.

* Demo 10: The intersections of the four circles are cocyclical.

* Demo 11: The medians of the triangle (green) are the bisectors of the triangle (red) joining the middle of the sides.

* Demo 12: The perpendiculars to the sides of a quadrilateral passing through the middle of the opposite side intersect at the same point.

* Demo 15: Napoleon's theorem.

* Demo 16 : Desargues's theorem.

* Demo 17 : Pappus's theorem.

* Demo 20 : Area comparison

# USAGE

* Clone or download the directory .

* Open `geom.html` in your browser.

* Build your own problem, or drop one of the json files to the workspace.

* A construction always starts with some points. From these you can build other objects : segments, lines, circles, etc. 

* To add an element to the problem, click on the corresponding icon in the toolbox, then follow the instructions in the bottom status line.

* A free point is represented by a circle. It can be moved with the mouse.

* A constructed point is represented by a disk. It cannot be moved by itself.

* A constrained point is represented by a square. It can be moved along its path.

* To select an element, click on its name in the list. It will be displayed hilited.

* To unselect an element, click again on its name.

* To change the color of an element, click on its colored square and choose another color in the palette.
